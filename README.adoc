== The Goal ==
An exercise to create a minimalistic and, yet, operational operating system. Kratos is my favourite fictional character from the God of War game series. I think, he embodies several great virtues and some of them are persistance and perseverance in reaching the set goals. Those I lack and this OS is also an attempt to practice them. My goal here is to learn how an operating system works by creating one.
